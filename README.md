# About

**Status dashboard** is a project developed by [Afonso de Mori](https://afonsodemori.com).

It's a frontend panel to consume the data supplied by [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/about)'s API.

The project is developed in simple HTML and JavaScript (jQuery) so it can be hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and "never" get down :)
